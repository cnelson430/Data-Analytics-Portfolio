# Clarissa's Portfolio

My name is Clarissa Nelson, and I am an emerging Data Analyst. In an effort to gain hands on experience and continue building my portfolio, I have created this repository to showcase the analytical skills I have and provide an idea of how I could possibly add value to prospecting companies in the future. I am currently skilled in SQL, Tableau, R and Python and I hope that by sharing this, potential employers will be able to gather an idea of who I am and what I am capable of. 

# Project 1: BellaBeat Case Study

This is a capstone project I did to apply the skills learned in my Google Data Analytics Certificate program to a business problem.

* Understand the Business Problem: Analyze trends in smart device usage - help to identify potential growth opportunities and recommend market strategy improvements for BellaBeat.
* Data Collection and Preparation: Data was taken from the publicly available FitBit Fitness Data Tracker dataset on Kaggle
* Data Visualization : Use tools like Tableau, R, and Python to transform the data
* Identify Trends and Patterns: Analyze visualizations to gather insights and prepare for storytelling
* Make Recommendations: Summarize key findings from the analysis and suggest innovative ideas based on the data
